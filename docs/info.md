## How it works

A D latch, also known as a data latch or transparent latch, is a fundamental building block in digital circuits, primarily used for storing a single bit of binary data (0 or 1).

## How to test

To test, do the simulation and observe the characteristics of the simulation results. Essentially, when Enable is low (0), the output retains its previous state, regardless of the D input. However, when Enable is high (1), the output directly reflects the D input.
